        title: `Biden: 'The pandemic is over' `,
information: `President Joe Biden said he believes the Covid-19 pandemic is "over" in an appearance on CBS' "60 Minutes," but acknowledged the US still has a "problem" with the virus that has killed more than 1 million Americans.

"The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with Covid. We're still doing a lot of work on it. It's -- but the pandemic is over," Biden said.
The US government still designates Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency and the World Health Organization says it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. But the President's comments follow other hopeful comments from global health leaders.`,

title: 'Spain wins FIBA EuroBasket 2022 with victory vs. France, Willy Hernangomez named MVP',
information:`After an exciting tournament, Spain took home the gold medal at FIBA EuroBasket 2022 with a 88-76 victory over France on Sunday. Toronto Raptors forward Juancho Hernangomez led the way for Spain with 27 points and five rebounds, while his brother, Willy Hernangomez of the New Orleans Pelicans added 14 points and eight rebounds of his own. 

Willy Hernangomez was named the MVP of the tournament with averages 17.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game. New York Knicks guard Evan Fournier paced France with 23 points and a pair of assists, while Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert added six points and six rebounds. Ultimately though, their production just wasn't enough to bring home the gold for France. 

"It's hard to explain how I feel with words. I am very proud of my teammates, the coaching staff, the whole Spanish federation - from the top to the bottom," Hernangomez said of Spain's victory. "We much deserve this gold medal, the way we grew and developed through the tournament. It was something amazing. The trust that was inside the locker room was something special. I'm just so proud, so lucky to be around those guys. Because they trusted me from the beginning. I'm just thankful to be part of this amazing team."`,
